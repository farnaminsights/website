                                    <p>We are college students at Yale who have come together to create a service that will help prospective college applicants get into the best college that they possibly can. Our values are reflective of our backgrounds: we are inclusive, diverse, and, above all, extremely motivated to provide the best experience for our students. We come from all over the United States, from the sunny shores of California to the frosty winters of Michigan to the exciting festivities of Louisiana to the rolling green hills of Connecticut. We are Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Sikhs, and non-religious. We are studying statistics, economics, psychology, computer science, philosophy, mathematics, history, and every other subject imaginable. We fish, sail, play soccer, rugby, hockey, football, and even the occasional game of spikeball. No matter who you are, we will be able to understand you as a person and work with your background to shape the best application for you.</p>

                            <p>The time spent applying to colleges is quite challenging, and having someone with experience to help navigate the process can be an intangible asset. As college admissions consultants, we will offer students the complete college admissions package at a price guaranteed to beat any of our competitors without sacrificing any of the quality. A brief summary of our process:</p>

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                            <div class="service-item">

                                <h4>Extracurricular and summer planning advice</h4>
                                <p>College admissions has become more than just your grades and test scores; most colleges now take a holistic approach to admissions and want to see that applicants are interesting with unique interests and abilities. We will help students find the right programs and activities to boost their extracurricular profile.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                <h4>Standardized testing tutoring</h4>
                                <p>Even though colleges are looking at applicants holistically, students are still applying to an academic institution. An applicant can not gain admissions without at least meeting a baseline SAT/ACT score and GPA. While colleges don’t officially admit to having baseline scores, we know how important it is to exceed the baseline to even have a chance at admission.</p>

                                <h4>Finding the right colleges for you</h4>
                                <p>There are over 5,300 colleges in the United States, and finding the right one can be extremely difficult. Applicants have to consider academic fit (programs, majors, academic rigor), social fit (school size, student athletics, Greek life), and geographical fit (climate, distance to home). Through our program, we use students’ responses to their ideal college to hand-tailor a college list for each and every applicant.</p>

                        </div>

                                <h4>Application framing</h4>
                                <p>The college application is a student’s only method of expressing who they are beyond the numbers to the admissions office. The way an application is framed is extremely important, and we know how to turn a student’s unique abilities and extracurriculars into an application that will return a high admissions yield.</p>

                                <h4>Essay brainstorming and guidance</h4>
                                <p>The essay is the crux of any college application. Ask many of the students attending elite colleges what they thought was the deciding factor in their admission, and the majority will say the essay. While an amazing essay by itself will not guarantee admission, not having an amazing essay will almost guarantee rejection. We work with applicants to craft their essay and provide structural and writing support.</p>

                                <h4>Timeline management</h4>
                                <p>The college application season is by far the busiest time of a high school student’s life. Applicants have to juggle their schoolwork, extracurriculars, social life, and their college applications at the same time. To make matters worse, different colleges have different requirements and different deadlines, and staying on top of it can be next to impossible. We alleviate this burden by completely taking over the applicant’s college agenda, sending them reminders for each and every deadline they have and working with them to have application material ready well before they are due.</p>

                                <p>We give students our personal cell phone numbers and emails so that they can contact us at any time for any reason; our imperative is to make sure students feel supported and get the help they need during one of the most stressful time periods of their lives.</p>
